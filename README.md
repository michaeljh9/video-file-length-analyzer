# video-file-length-analyzer

The video-file-length-analyser tool is a script where the user gives it the folder location of a bunch of video files. It then creates a CSV file showing the video lengths of all the video files it finds.

The purpose of this script is to tell you how much time in video length you have.

The motivation I had for creating this script is I own a collection of video lecture series. When I would watch and follow along with one, I would want to know how much I have gone through and how much more I have ahead. The outputted CSV file would be super valuable turning it into an Excel file whereby I would note where I am and use that to determine how much I've accomplished and how much more is ahead.
